### Covid-D : Reliable and secure way in the need of identifying infected individuals, with covid-19 based upon Deep Convolutional Neural Network(CNN)

## 1. Motivation
- From the end of 2019 to the present, the most discussed and heated topic is the covid-19 related themes and its promising solutions in the detection of covid-19 among both Medical and IT researchers. Why is that, as it is known that the spreading speed of SARS-CoV-2 is tremendously speeding up while the world economy of the world is continuously decreasing respectively. So far a lot of possible ways have been being used in order to decrease the number of patient infected with covid-19 in a numerical statistics. Currently in medicine the ways to know whether one has the virus that caused by covid-19 are by PCR, Antigen, Antibody, Nasopharyngeal and Oropharyngeal swab and also chest radiography imaging and so on. The PCR. PCR is good choice however the test is inconvenient and takes longer to get the results back. Antigen testing: Rapid testing. The findings are less susceptible to COVID-19 and therefore have a higher false negative rate (you may test negative but have the virus actually). The test is very specific, so you've got COVID-19 if it is positive. UT Southwestern uses antigen testing for screening because of this and requires confirmation of a negative antigen test with the PCR gold standard test. Antibody testing : After illness. Mild cases of COVID-19 do not cause detectable antibodies to produce. So, prior infection does not necessarily rule out a negative antibody test. Research on these tests continues to evolve, and we still do not know how long COVID-19 antibodies last. Nasopharyngeal and Oropharyngeal swab. NP / OP swabs may likely show a false-negative test.
